# Auto-Language-Stats

Get Summary of Your Language Stats with Analyze (Coming Soon)

- ```npm run load``` to Load Data from GitHub API (**Don't forget to change Username to yours in loadData.js**)

- ```npm run anal``` to start analysis and save into csv

You can look at example for output csv, I recommend putting it in Excel, convert to xlsx and create table to unlock ability to sort by each language!
